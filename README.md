# RitualNow

## Roadmap
- [ ] REDESIGN: Explore an "assembly-line"-esque concept...
  - Parts come down the line for the player to assemble
  - Player must assemble parts according to the blueprint assembled
  - Game could explore other roles of factory process, such as QA and packing...
- [ ] Add a property drawer for ease in adding ItemHandles
- [ ] Fix touch support for WebGL builds
- [x] Fix a bug where players can score points while the game is not in session
- [ ] Add a gravity well (right click? long touch?)
- [ ] Think about a way to let players grab toys buried under other toys
- [ ] Think about a way to get rid of completed boxes (and introduce new ones)?
- [ ] Add multiple levels

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add support for default variables for UnityEvent func calls
- [ ] Add a proper Input Manager
