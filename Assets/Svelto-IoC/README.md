Svelto IoC container for Unity 3D
=====================================

Svelto IoC Container is the evolution of my first IoC container that I created as Proof of concept. Svelto IoC is extensively used in the project I am working on Robocraft (http://www.robocraftgame.com)

Please read my blog post for more information: http://www.sebaslab.com/svelto-inversion-of-control-container/
